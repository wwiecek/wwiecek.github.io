I am a researcher working on applied problems in global health, epidemiology, and development economics. I hold a PhD in statistics and run a small consultancy which works with academics, NGOs and charities.

I'm a Consulting Director at [Development Innovation Lab at University of Chicago](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/news/dil-launch/), currently working with the lab's founder Michael Kremer on studies of water quality interventions and deworming, as well as supporting the lab's other statistical work. Iâ€™m passionate about making [Bayesian meta-analysis methods](https://github.com/wwiecek/baggr/) more accessible to social scientists and using statistical inference to better support effective altruist causes. My own research into this has been funded by grants from [Schmidt Futures](https://schmidtfutures.com/) (2019), [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/) (2022), and [FTX Future Fund](https://ftxfuturefund.org/) (2022, oops). 

Since 2020 I have also been working on COVID, including research on [fractional dosing of vaccines](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2116932119), [accelerating vaccine supply](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6534/1107.summary), and supporting human challenge trials (as an advisor to [1Day Sooner](https://www.1daysooner.org/)). For my work on COVID I was awarded an [Emergent Ventures prize](https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures).

As a consultant at Certara (2014-2022) I worked on all stages of drug development, with focus on improving Bayesian modelling techniques in predicting real-world effectiveness of treatments, health technology assessment, and epidemiological modelling.

<!-- I studied Mathematics (BSci, MSci at AGH), specialising in algorithmic theory, graph theory, probability. I hold a PhD in statistics from UHasselt. [My thesis](https://ibiostat.be/publications/phd/witoldwiecek.pdf) was on Bayesian hierarchical modelling and Bayesian networks. -->
